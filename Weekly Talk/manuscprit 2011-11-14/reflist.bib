  abstract = {The Hox protein family consists of homeodomain-containing transcription
	factors that are primary determinants of cell fate during animal
	development. Specific Hox function appears to rely on protein-protein
	interactions; however, the partners involved in these interactions
	and their function are largely unknown. Disconnected Interacting
	Protein 1 (DIP1) was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a 0–12-h
	Drosophila embryo library designed to identify proteins that interact
	with Ultrabithorax (Ubx), a Drosophila Hox protein. The Ubx ·DIP1
	physical interaction was confirmed using phage display, immunoprecipitation,
	pull-down assays, and gel retardation analysis. Ectopic expression
	of DIP1 in wing and haltere imaginal discs malforms the adult structures
	and enhances a decreased Ubx expression phenotype, establishing a
	genetic interaction. Ubx can generate a ternary complex by simultaneously
	binding its target DNA and DIP1. A large region of Ubx, including
	the repression domain, is required for interaction with DIP1. These
	more variable sequences may be key to the differential Hox function
	observed in vivo. The Ubx ·DIP1 interaction prevents transcriptional
	activation by Ubx in a modified yeast one-hybrid assay, suggesting
	that DIP1 may modulate transcriptional regulation by Ubx. The DIP1
	sequence contains two dsRNA-binding domains, and DIP1 binds double-stranded
	RNA with a 1000-fold higher affinity than either single-stranded
	RNA or double-stranded DNA. The strong interaction of Ubx with an
	RNA-binding protein suggests a wider range of proteins may influence
	Ubx function than previously appreciated.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Polymorphisms in human genes are being described in remarkable
	numbers. Determining which polymorphisms and which environmental
	factors are associated with common, complex diseases has become a
	daunting task. This is partly because the effect of any single genetic
	variation will likely be dependent on other genetic variations (gene–gene
	interaction or epistasis) and environmental factors (gene–environment
	interaction). Detecting and characterizing interactions among multiple
	factors is both a statistical and a computational challenge. To address
	this problem, we have developed a multifactor dimensionality reduction
	(MDR) method for collapsing high-dimensional genetic data into a
	single dimension thus permitting interactions to be detected in relatively
	small sample sizes. In this paper, we describe the MDR approach and
	an MDR software package.Results: We developed a program that integrates
	MDR with a cross-validation strategy for estimating the classification
	and prediction error of multifactor models. The software can be used
	to analyze interactions among 2–15 genetic and/or environmental
	factors. The dataset may contain up to 500 total variables and a
	maximum of 4000 study subjects.Availability: Information on obtaining
	the executable code, example data, example analysis, and documentation
	is available upon request.Contact: moore@phg.mc.vanderbilt.eduSupplementary

  number = {Suppl 1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The key roles of epistatic interactions between multiple
	genetic variants in the pathogenesis of complex diseases notwithstanding,
	the detection of such interactions remains a great challenge in genome-wide
	association studies. Although some existing multi-locus approaches
	have shown their successes in small-scale case-control data, the
	"combination explosion" course prohibits their applications to genome-wide
	analysis. It is therefore indispensable to develop new methods that
	are able to reduce the search space for epistatic interactions from
	an astronomic number of all possible combinations of genetic variants
	to a manageable set of candidates.RESULTS:We studied case-control
	data from the viewpoint of binary classification. More precisely,
	we treated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers as categorical
	features and adopted the random forest to discriminate cases against
	controls. On the basis of the gini importance given by the random
	forest, we designed a sliding window sequential forward feature selection
	(SWSFS) algorithm to select a small set of candidate SNPs that could
	minimize the classification error and then statistically tested up
	to three-way interactions of the candidates. We compared this approach
	with three existing methods on three simulated disease models and
	showed that our approach is comparable to, sometimes more powerful
	than, the other methods. We applied our approach to a genome-wide
	case-control dataset for Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and
	successfully identified two SNPs that were reported to be associated
	with this disease.CONCLUSION:Besides existing pure statistical approaches,
	we demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating machine learning
	methods into genome-wide case-control studies. The gini importance
	offers yet another measure for the associations between SNPs and
	complex diseases, thereby complementing existing statistical measures
	to facilitate the identification of epistatic interactions and the
	understanding of epistasis in the pathogenesis of complex diseases.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in genome research have accelerated the process of
	locating candidate genes and the variable sites within them and have
	simplified the task of genotype measurement. The development of statistical
	and computational strategies to utilize information on hundreds —
	soon thousands — of variable loci to investigate the relationships
	between genome variation and phenotypic variation has not kept pace,
	particularly for quantitative traits that do not follow simple Mendelian
	patterns of inheritance. We present here the combinatorial partitioning
	method (CPM) that examines multiple genes, each containing multiple
	variable loci, to identify partitions of multilocus genotypes that
	predict interindividual variation in quantitative trait levels. We
	illustrate this method with an application to plasma triglyceride
	levels collected on 188 males, ages 20–60 yr, ascertained without
	regard to health status, from Rochester, Minnesota. Genotype information
	included measurements at 18 diallelic loci in six coronary heart
	disease–candidate susceptibility gene regions: APOA1-C3-A4, APOB,
	APOE,LDLR, LPL, and PON1. To illustrate the CPM, we evaluated all
	possible partitions of two-locus genotypes into two to nine partitions
	(∼106 evaluations). We found that many combinations of loci are
	involved in sets of genotypic partitions that predict triglyceride
	variability and that the most predictive sets show nonadditivity.
	These results suggest that traditional methods of building multilocus
	models that rely on statistically significant marginal, single-locus
	effects, may fail to identify combinations of loci that best predict
	trait variability. The CPM offers a strategy for exploring the high-dimensional
	genotype state space so as to predict the quantitative trait variation
	in the population at large that does not require the conditioning
	of the analysis on a prespecified genetic model.},

	(RAS) has been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis
	of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that RAS genes might
	be among the susceptibility genes of nonfamilial structural AF and
	conducted a genetic case-control study to demonstrate this.Methods
	and Results— A total of 250 patients with documented nonfamilial
	structural AF and 250 controls were selected. The controls were matched
	to cases on a 1-to-1 basis with regard to age, gender, presence of
	left ventricular dysfunction, and presence of significant valvular
	heart disease. The ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism, the
	T174M, M235T, G-6A, A-20C, G-152A, and G-217A polymorphisms of the
	angiotensinogen gene, and the A1166C polymorphism of the angiotensin
	II type I receptor gene were genotyped. In multilocus haplotype analysis,
	the angiotensinogen gene haplotype profile was significantly different
	between cases and controls (χ2=62.5, P=0.0002). In single-locus
	analysis, M235T, G-6A, and G-217A were significantly associated with
	AF. Frequencies of the M235, G-6, and G-217 alleles were significantly
	higher in cases than in controls (P=0.000, 0.005, and 0.002, respectively).
	The odds ratios for AF were 2.5 (95% CI 1.7 to 3.3) with M235/M235
	plus M235/T235 genotype, 3.3 (95% CI 1.3 to 10.0) with G-6/G-6 genotype,
	and 2.0 (95% CI 1.3 to 2.5) with G-217/G-217 genotype. Furthermore,
	significant gene-gene interactions were detected by the multifactor-dimensionality
	reduction method and multilocus linkage disequilibrium tests.Conclusions—
	This study demonstrates the association of RAS gene polymorphisms
	with nonfamilial structural AF and may provide the rationale for
	clinical trials to investigate the use of ACE inhibitor or angiotensin
	II antagonist in the treatment of structural AF.},
